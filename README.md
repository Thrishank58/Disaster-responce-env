# 🌊 Disaster Response Coordinator Agent

## 🧠 Overview
This project simulates a **real-world disaster response system** where an AI agent must manage limited resources during a flood emergency.

The agent allocates:
- 🚑 Rescue teams  
- 🍞 Food supplies  
- 💊 Medical aid  

across multiple zones while conditions evolve dynamically (rising water levels, injuries, and access constraints).

---

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance
Disaster response is a **high-stakes decision-making problem** involving:
- Limited resources  
- Incomplete information  
- Rapidly changing conditions  

This environment models realistic trade-offs faced by:
- Government disaster agencies  
- NGOs  
- Emergency response teams  

---

## ⚙️ Environment Design

### 🧾 Observation Space
Each timestep provides:
- Zone-wise population  
- Number of injured people  
- Flood level severity  
- Accessibility (e.g., road blocked)  

---

### 🎯 Action Space
The agent decides:
- Allocation of rescue teams  
- Distribution of food supplies  
- Distribution of medical resources  

for each zone.

---

### 🔁 Environment API
The environment follows the **OpenEnv specification**:

- `reset()` → initializes environment  
- `step(action)` → advances simulation  
- `state()` → returns current state  

---

## 🧪 Tasks

### 🟢 Easy
- Single-zone environment  
- Basic allocation decisions  

### 🟡 Medium
- Multiple zones  
- Resource balancing required  

### 🔴 Hard
- Multiple zones with blocked access  
- Higher uncertainty and trade-offs  

---

## 📊 Reward Function

The reward function provides **continuous feedback**:

- ✅ Rewards reducing injuries  
- ✅ Rewards balanced resource allocation  
- ❌ Penalizes neglect and worsening conditions  

---

## 📏 Evaluation (Grader)

Score range: **0.0 – 1.0**

Based on:
- 🧍 Survival rate (minimizing injuries)  
- ⚖️ Fairness across zones  

The grader is:
- Deterministic  
- State-dependent  
- Non-trivial  

---

## 🤖 Baseline Agent

Includes a baseline agent that:
- Uses OpenAI API (if available)  
- Falls back to a rule-based strategy  
- Adapts resource allocation based on zone conditions
